- Live reload for real-time updates.
- Support for custom add-ons and configurations.

Using Storybook

Storybook is configured to load stories from the src/components directory. Each component can have one or more associated .stories.js or .stories.jsx files.

Adding a New Story

    1. Create a new component in src/components/YourComponent.

    2. Add a .stories.js file in the same directory, e.g. YourComponent.stories.js:

        import React from 'react';
        import YourComponent from './YourComponent';

        export default {
            title: 'YourComponent',
            component: YourComponent,
        };

        const Template = (args) => <YourComponent {...args} />;

        export const Default = Template.bind({});
        Default.args = {
            // Default props for the component
        };
    
    3. Run npm run storybook to see your new story.
